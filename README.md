## Impact of AI Study Tools on Student Academic Performance

### Project context
This repository contains my ongoing undergraduate dissertation research, which focuses on understanding how AI-based study tools influence student learning outcomes, study habits, and academic performance.

The study is exploratory in nature and aims to combine first-hand data collection with machine learning techniques to analyse patterns in student behaviour and performance.
